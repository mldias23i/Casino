Platform Casino Integration API

This is a solution for an exercise that was proposed to me. It was send to me a document which whas the documentation of a standard API that they use to communicate with their partners.
The exercise consisted of the following:
  - An implementation of 5 endpoints: getGames, GameLaunch, Bet, Win and Refund.
  - Transactions Bet, Win and Refund registered in a PostgreSQL database.
  - Implementation of 2 error codes of API.
  - Using authentication of requests.

Inside the folder there is another README file which explains how to use the application.
